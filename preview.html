  <p>Cannes Film Festival Grand Jury Prize winner BPM (BEATS PER MINUTE) is set in early 1990s Paris, as a group of activists goes to battle for those stricken with HIV/AIDS, taking on sluggish government agencies and major pharmaceutical companies in bold, invasive actions. These activists, many of whom are HIV-positive, embrace their mission with literal life-or-death urgency. Amid rallies, protests, fierce debates and ecstatic dance parties, newcomer Nathan falls in love with Sean, the group’s radical firebrand, and their passion sparks against the shadow of mortality as the activists fight for a breakthrough.</p>

  <p>In an epic film journey led by the internationally renowned artist Ai Weiwei, HUMAN FLOW gives a powerful visual expression to this massive human migration. The documentary elucidates both the staggering scale of the refugee crisis and its profoundly personal human impact. Captured over the course of a year amid 23 countries, the film follows a chain of urgent human stories that stretches across the globe, and acts as a witness to its subjects and their desperate search for safety, shelter and justice; from the haunting lure of lives left behind to the unknown potential of the future. This visceral work of cinema is a testament to the unassailable human spirit and poses one of the questions that will define this century: Will our global society emerge from fear, isolation, and self-interest and choose a path of openness, freedom, and respect for humanity?</p>
