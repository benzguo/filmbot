    <p>Part of a New Wave in Canadian cinema during the late ’80s, this movie marked the feature debut for both writer/director Patricia Rozema and star Sheila McCarthy, who won Canada’s top film prize, the Genie Award, for Best Actress. “Isn’t life the strangest thing you’ve ever seen?” muses Polly (McCarthy), a dreamer who lands a gig as Girl Friday for art gallery impresario Gabrielle (Paule Baillargeon, Genie winner for Best Supporting Actress). Exploring female solidarity (or lack thereof), same-sex romance, and flights of fantasy, Rozema’s film won over critics—and is overdue for rediscovery upon its 30th anniversary.</p>

    <p>Largely confined to supporting parts for decades, the beloved Harry Dean Stanton receives a rare leading role (written specifically for him) as Lucky: a staunchly independent, chain-smoking nonagenarian living in a remote desert town. As his life winds down, Lucky is facing the tricky business of self-exploration, with every trip to the local diner and bar taking on greater significance. Co-starring Stanton superfan David Lynch, this wry character study offers a moving tribute to one of the cinema’s greatest treasures. A Magnolia Pictures release</p>

These activists, many of whom are HIV-positive, embrace their mission with literal life-or-death urgency. Amid rallies, protests, fierce debates and ecstatic dance parties, newcomer Nathan falls in love with Sean, the group’s radical firebrand, and their passion sparks against the shadow of mortality as the activists fight for a breakthrough.</p>

    <p>In an epic film journey led by the internationally renowned artist Ai Weiwei, HUMAN FLOW gives a powerful visual expression to this massive human migration. The documentary elucidates both the staggering scale of the refugee crisis and its profoundly personal human impact. Captured over the course of a year amid 23 countries, the film follows a chain of urgent human stories that stretches across the globe, and acts as a witness to its subjects and their desperate search for safety, shelter and justice; from the haunting lure of lives left behind to the unknown potential of the future. This visceral work of cinema is a testament to the unassailable human spirit and poses one of the questions that will define this century: Will our global society emerge from fear, isolation, and self-interest and choose a path of openness, freedom, and respect for humanity?</p>

In the early 1990s, ACT UP—in France, as in the U.S.—was on the front lines of AIDS activism. Its members, mostly gay, HIV-positive men, stormed drug company and government offices in “Silence=Death” T-shirts, facing down complacent suits with the urgency of their struggle for life. Robin Campillo (Eastern Boys) depicts their comradeship and tenacity in waking up the world to the disease that was killing them and movingly dramatizes the persistence of passionate love affairs even in dire circumstances. All the actors, many of them unknown, are splendid in this film, which not only celebrates the courage of ACT UP but also tacitly provides a model of resistance to the forces of destruction running rampant today.

    <p>Ends Thursday! A new 4K restoration scanned from the original camera negative.
The sacrifice in Andrei Tarkovsky’s final film, completed only months before his death from cancer at the age of 54, is performed by Alexander, an aging professor who strikes a deal with God in order to avert humankind’s self-obliteration after the sudden outbreak of World War III. The Sacrifice is a work made under the sign of one of Tarkovsky’s masters, Ingmar Bergman: the film was shot in Swedish with several of Bergman’s principal actors, including Erland Josephson in the lead, and his DP Sven Nykvist. It is, most certainly, a final testament. But it is also, like every Tarkovsky film, a plunge into the uncanny and the uncharted. A Kino Lorber release.</p>

Q&A with Ruben Östlund following the 5:30pm screening on 10/27. We’re also giving away a pair of posters signed by Östlund! Tweet at us your ticket confirmation for the 5:30pm screening to enter.
A precisely observed, thoroughly modern comedy of manners, Ruben Östlund’s Palme d’0r–winner revolves around Christian (Claes Bang), a well-heeled contemporary art curator at a Stockholm museum. While preparing his new exhvibit—a four-by-four-meter zone designated as a “sanctuary of trust and caring”—Christian falls prey to a pickpocketing scam, which triggers an overzealous response and then a crisis of conscience. Featuring several instant-classic scenes and a vivid supporting cast (Elisabeth Moss, Dominic West, and noted motion-capture actor Terry Notary), The Square is the most ambitious film yet by one of contemporary cinema’s most incisive social satirists, the rare movie to have as many laughs as ideas.
